Welcome to the high-level overview of the Luzid TypeScript SDK.

We included a page for each of Luzid's API, i.e. `mutator`, `snapshots` and so on.

For each method a short description and example are provided. Where it made sense full example
is provided as well.

For more detailed API information please refer to the hosted SDK documentation for each
particular language:

- [TypeScript](https://luzid.app/luzid-sdk/docs/ts/classes/luzid_sdk.LuzidSdk.html)

## Running Examples

Whenever a full example is provided it is folded up like so:

<p>
<details>
<summary>Full Example</summary>
Full Example that you can run will be here.
</details>
</p>


You can read through the examples and you can run them as well. To do that you need the
following:

1. Run the `luzid` backend in a terminal on your machine
2. Run the Luzid UI on your machine

Now each example will be able to connect to the locally running luzid and you can inspect the
results in the UI.

TIP:

NOTE: that the imports are prefixed with `https://esm.sh/` which is only needed when running
them on CodePen. You would import the packages as usual without that prefix.

## Running Examples on CodePen

You may prefer to run the examples directly on CodePen. Therefore they are provided inside a
[single collection](https://codepen.io/collection/MgkZdm) that you can access.
